# zk-age

**By [Orkid Labs](https://www.orkidlabs.com)** — privacy-first crypto engineering

Privacy-preserving age verification for web2 applications, powered by zero-knowledge proofs, [zkVerify](https://zkverify.io), and an **FMD physics energy model** adapted from the [orkid](https://github.com/orkid-labs/orkid) MEV detection engine.

> Prove you're 18+ without revealing your birthdate. Every proof is scored by its thermodynamic energy — the negentropy extracted from private data.

## What it does

zk-age lets any web2 application verify a user's age without collecting or storing their birthdate. The user generates a Groth16 zero-knowledge proof that demonstrates `current_year - birth_year >= threshold`, and the proof is verified on zkVerify — a high-performance blockchain dedicated to ZK proof verification.

> **Status:** The issuer signature scheme uses a **Poseidon-based Schnorr-like signature** (`pk = Poseidon(sk)`, `sig = sk + Poseidon(pk, m, r)`, verified in-circuit via `Poseidon(sig - h) === pk`). Forging requires a preimage attack on Poseidon over BN254. The issuer secret key is hardcoded for demo purposes — production deployment should use an HSM or secure key ceremony.

**The user never reveals their actual age. The verifier never sees the birthdate. Only the boolean result (eligible / not eligible) is confirmed.**

### Why this matters

Every age-gated website today collects birthdates — creating massive PII liability, GDPR exposure, and data breach risk. zk-age eliminates the need to store this data entirely. The proof is the verification.

## The thermodynamic framing

zk-age applies the **Financial Molecular Dynamics (FMD)** physics framework from the orkid MEV detection engine to score ZK proofs by quality. This is not metaphor — the mathematics of statistical mechanics, information theory, and zero-knowledge proofs are fundamentally connected.

### Negentropy = Information = Order

From Brillouin's negentropy principle (1953) and the orkid blog post ["Negentropy = Information: A Generalized Mathematical Framework"](https://www.orkidlabs.com/blog/negentropy-information-generalized-framework/):

> **Negentropy = H_max − H_actual = D_KL(p_informed || p_uninformed)**

A birthdate is a **high-entropy state** — without verification, anyone could claim any age. A ZK proof is a **negentropy extraction**: it converts private, chaotic data into structured, verifiable order (the boolean "age >= threshold") without revealing the underlying value.

For the zk-age circuit (17 constraints, threshold=18):

```
N = constraint_count × log₂(threshold) = 17 × log₂(18) ≈ 70.9 bits
```

This is the Shannon entropy reduction — the amount of uncertainty about the user's age eliminated by the proof. Each constraint in the circuit contributes ~1 bit of negentropy. The verifier learns the user is above the threshold without learning the exact age.

### Landauer's principle

From Landauer (1961) and the orkid blog post ["Blockchain Thermodynamics: How Negentropy Explains MEV, Consensus, and Arbitrage"](https://www.orkidlabs.com/blog/blockchain-thermodynamics-negentropy-mev-physics/):

> **E ≥ k_B × T × ln(2) per bit erased**

Proof generation pays the thermodynamic cost of extracting negentropy. The compute energy spent generating the Groth16 proof is the Landauer cost of creating 70.9 bits of order from private chaos. The verifier receives this order without paying the cost.

### The MEV closure analogy

From the orkid blog post ["A Formal Mathematical Model of Blockchain Negentropy and MEV Dynamics"](https://www.orkidlabs.com/blog/formal-negentropy-model-mev-dynamics-graph-diffusion/):

> **dM/dt = a·δ + b·H_M − c·χ(I)·M**

In MEV: information closes arbitrage opportunities. In zk-age: the ZK proof "closes" the uncertainty about the user's age. The proof is the information injection that collapses the entropy of the unverifiable claim into a deterministic boolean.

## The energy model

The proof energy model is adapted from the **route energy formula** in the orkid FMD physics engine (`fmd-physics/src/route_energy.rs`):

### FMD route energy (orkid)

```
energy = net_bps × √(depth_ratio × timing_factor) × latency_decay × (1 − gas_penalty)
```

This scores arbitrage paths by net output, liquidity depth, timing, and gas cost. Higher energy = more profitable route.

### Age proof energy (zk-age)

```
energy = confidence × √(depth_ratio × timing_factor) × latency_decay × (1 − cost_penalty)
```

This scores ZK proofs by issuer confidence, threshold strictness, recency, proof speed, and verification cost. Higher energy = higher quality proof.

| Factor | FMD (MEV) | zk-age (ZK proofs) |
|--------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Confidence** | Pool TVL (liquidity depth) | Issuer trust score (credential strength) |
| **Depth ratio** | Reserve ratio / trade size | Confidence / log₁₀(threshold) |
| **Timing factor** | 1/√(hops) | exp(−age / half_life) |
| **Latency decay** | (1 − 0.001 × hops × latency) | 1 / (1 + total_latency × 0.0001) |
| **Cost penalty** | Gas units × gas cost | zkVerify submission cost |

### Committor function

Adapted from the TPS (Transition Path Sampling) committor in the FMD engine, which predicts the probability of reaching a profitable state:

```
committor = (depth_ratio / (1 + depth_ratio)) × timing_factor × (1 − cost_penalty × 0.5)
```

This estimates the probability that the proof is valid and uncontested — a "rare event" prediction for proof quality. A fresh proof from a trusted issuer with a high threshold yields a committor near 1.0.

### Example

For a proof of age >= 18, issued by a government ID (trust=0.95), generated in 572ms:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Energy | 779.51 |
| Negentropy | 70.9 bits |
| Committor | 98.7% |
| Depth ratio | 75.68 |
| Latency decay | 0.943 |
| Cost penalty | 0.00001 |

## How it works

```

1. **Issue**: An ID authority (government, digital ID provider) signs a commitment to the user's birth year.

2. **Prove**: The backend generates a Groth16 proof using snarkjs + the compiled circom circuit. The proof demonstrates:
   - The user possesses a valid signed birthdate commitment
   - `current_year - birth_year >= threshold`
   - Without revealing `birth_year`
   - The FMD energy model scores the proof by quality (negentropy, committor, latency)

3. **Verify**: The proof is submitted to zkVerify via the Kurier REST API for on-chain verification. zkVerify returns a transaction hash and statement hash, providing a permanent, auditable verification record.

4. **Result**: The frontend displays "Age verified — you're 18+" with the energy score and negentropy extracted.

## The circuit

The circom circuit (`circuit/age.circom`) has:

- **3 public inputs**: `current_year`, `threshold`, `issuer_pubkey_hash`
- **3 private inputs**: `birth_year`, `issuer_signature`, `signature_randomness`
- **17 constraints**: age range check (Num2Bits) + signature verification

```
Public outputs:  current_year, threshold, issuer_pubkey_hash
Private (hidden): birth_year, issuer_signature, signature_randomness
```

The birth year is never in the public signals. The verifier learns only that the age check passed.

### Production upgrade path

The circuit uses a Poseidon-based Schnorr-like signature (`sig = sk + Poseidon(pk, m, r)`, verified via `Poseidon(sig - h) === pk`). Further production hardening:
- **HSM-backed issuer key** instead of hardcoded demo secret
- **EdDSA on BabyJubJub** for full digital signature semantics (non-repudiation)
- **Merkle-tree issuer registry** for revocation and multi-issuer support
- The circuit structure and zkVerify integration remain identical

## Tech stack

| Layer | Technology | Why |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Circuit | circom 2.2.3 | Industry standard ZK circuit compiler |
| Proof system | Groth16 (snarkjs) | Smallest proofs (~200 bytes), fastest verification |
| Curve | BN128 / BN254 | Supported by zkVerify, EVM-compatible |
| Backend | Rust (axum, tokio) | Performance, safety, production-grade |
| Energy model | FMD physics (adapted from orkid) | Thermodynamic proof quality scoring |
| zkVerify integration | Kurier REST API | No blockchain knowledge required for web2 teams |
| Frontend | Vanilla HTML/JS | Zero dependencies, instant load, works everywhere |

## zkVerify integration

zk-age integrates with zkVerify via the [Kurier REST API](https://docs.zkverify.io/overview/getting-started/kurier):

1. **Register VK**: The circuit's verification key is registered once via `POST /register-vk`, returning a `vkHash` cached for all future submissions.

2. **Submit proof**: Each generated proof is submitted via `POST /submit-proof` with the `vkHash`, proof, and public signals.

3. **Poll status**: The backend polls `GET /job-status/{job_id}` until the proof is `Verified` or `Finalized` on zkVerify.

4. **Return result**: The verification result includes the zkVerify transaction hash and statement hash, providing an auditable on-chain verification record.

### Configuration

Set the `ZKVERIFY_API_KEY` environment variable to enable zkVerify integration:

```bash
export ZKVERIFY_API_KEY="your-kurier-api-key"
# Optional: override zkVerify endpoint (defaults to testnet)
export ZKVERIFY_URL="https://testnet.kurier.xyz/api/v1"
```

Without an API key, the backend falls back to local snarkjs verification — the demo still works, but proofs aren't submitted to zkVerify.

### Production hardening

The backend is locked down for production deployment with two middleware layers:

1. **API key authentication** (`src/auth.rs`) — every sensitive endpoint (`/api/issue`, `/api/prove`, `/api/verify`, `/api/stats`, `/api/energy/*`) requires the `x-api-key` header to match `ORKID_API_KEY`. `/api/health` remains exempt so load balancers can reach it. Dev mode: if `ORKID_API_KEY` is unset, all requests are allowed.
2. **CORS restriction** (`src/auth.rs`) — cross-origin access is limited to the comma-separated list in `ORKID_CORS_ORIGINS`, defaulting to `http://localhost:3000`. Wildcard CORS is removed.

```bash
export ORKID_API_KEY="your-256-bit-secret"
export ORKID_CORS_ORIGINS="https://app.orkidlabs.xyz,http://localhost:3000"
```

## Thrive zkVerify Web2 Program (#44) — Grant Plan

### Ecosystem value proposition

zk-age drives **proof verification volume** to zkVerify. Every age-gated page view generates a proof and a zkVerify verification. A single e-commerce site with 100K daily age-gated page views generates 3M proofs/month — far exceeding the Milestone 3: Scale target of 250,000+ ZK Proofs sent to zkVerify.

### Revenue model

| Tier | Price | Target | Monthly proofs |
|------|-------|--------|----------------|
| Free | $0 | 1K verifications/month | Developer testing |
| Starter | $49/mo | 10K verifications/month | Small sites |
| Growth | $199/mo | 100K verifications/month | Mid-market |
| Enterprise | Custom | Unlimited | High-volume (alcohol, cannabis, gambling) |

Revenue is sustainable beyond the grant period through SaaS subscriptions. The marginal cost per verification approaches zero as zkVerify reduces on-chain verification costs by ~90% vs. verifying proofs directly on Ethereum.
